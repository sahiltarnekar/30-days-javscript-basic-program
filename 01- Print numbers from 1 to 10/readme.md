# 🟩 Day 1: Print Numbers from 1 to 10 (JavaScript)

## ✅ Program Goal
Print numbers from **1 to 10** using a **`for` loop** in JavaScript.

---

## 💻 Code:
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
### 📝 Explanation:
- The `for` loop is used to iterate from 1 to 10.
- `let i = 1`: Initialize the loop counter `i` to 1.
- `i <= 10`: Check if `i` is less than or equal to 10.
- `i++`: Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- `console.log(i)`: Print the current value of `i` to the console.
